# Password Storage Application

This is a password storage application developed using Python and SQLite3. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to securely store and manage their passwords.

## Features

- Create a master password to access the password vault.
- Store passwords for different websites along with the associated username.
- View and manage the stored passwords in a secure manner.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SQLite3
- tkinter
- hashlib

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:

   ```
   pip install tkinter hashlib
   ```

3. Run the application using the following command:

   ```
   python password_storage.py
   ```

4. Upon running the application, you will be prompted to create a master password. Enter the desired password and re-enter it for confirmation.

5. After successfully creating the master password, you can log in to the password vault by entering the master password.

6. Once logged in, you can add new passwords to the vault by clicking the "+" button. You will be prompted to enter the website, username, and password.

7. The stored passwords will be displayed in a tabular format, including the website, username, and an option to delete each entry.

8. To exit the application, simply close the main window.

Note: It is recommended to compile the application into an executable file for easier distribution and usage. You can use tools like PyInstaller to package the application into a standalone executable.

## Security Considerations

- The master password is hashed using the MD5 algorithm before being stored in the database to enhance security.
- The application uses SQLite3 for data storage, which is a lightweight database engine.
- Ensure that you have appropriate write permissions for the database file (`password_safe.db`) to avoid any issues with storing or accessing the passwords.

## Disclaimer

This application is provided as-is without any warranties or guarantees. It is essential to take necessary precautions to protect your master password and the database file. Be cautious when handling sensitive information and use the application responsibly.
